# WorkflowWizerd 🧙‍♂️
> **"Complexity is the enemy of execution."**

WorkflowWizerd is a minimalist productivity tool built to eliminate decision fatigue. Instead of overwhelming you with a "wall of tasks," it transforms complex projects into a guided, step-by-step experience.

## ✨ The Philosophy
Most project management tools act as digital filing cabinets—they store information but don't help you execute it. WorkflowWizerd acts as a **GPS for your work**. 

By utilizing a "Wizard" interface, the app focuses your attention on the **one next thing** you need to do, hiding the mental noise of the entire project until you are ready for it.

## 🚀 Key Features
- **Sequential Task Logic:** Tasks are revealed one by one. You only see Step B when Step A is complete.
- **Progress Tracking:** A dynamic, visual progress bar that updates in real-time.
- **Distraction-Free UI:** A minimalist dashboard designed to reduce cognitive load and keep you in "Flow State."
- **Rule-Based Automation:** Built-in logic that manages task dependencies and project states.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Backend:** [Python](https://www.python.org/) / [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/)
- **Database:** [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/) with [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) (for structured relational task flow)
- **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
- **Styling:** [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
